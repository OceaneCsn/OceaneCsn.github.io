This practical session aims at giving a medium/advanced overview of the RStudio IDE, as well as the necessary backgound to author Rmarkdown documents. Teaching material, tips and practical session are in French.

The demonstration data used as a guideline in the practical session is from the publication [Burghardt Schmitt et Al., Fluctuating, warm temperatures decrease the effect of a key floral repressor on flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana (2015)](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13799). It is inspired by [teaching material](https://github.com/scortijo/2021_L3_R) from Sandra Cortijo.

The Rmarkdown file that will be created during this practical session should be very similar to [this solution](https://oceanecsn.github.io/M1_Rmarkdown_course/).
