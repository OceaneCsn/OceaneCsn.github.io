I am a PhD Student in bioinformatics and biostatistics in the Biochemistry & Plant Molecular Physiology unit, Montpellier. I apply statistics and machine learning to genomic data to understand plants response to climate change. In particular, I am interested in reconstructing the regulatory pathways in *Arabidopsis thaliana* under high atmospheric CO$_2$ to explain the depletion of its mineral status.
