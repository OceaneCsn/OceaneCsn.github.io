To this end, graphical interfaces have been developed and allow a broad range of users to conduct standard analyses from RNA-seq data, even with little programming experience. Although existing solutions usually provide adequate procedures for normalization, exploration or differential expression, more advanced features, such as gene clustering or regulatory network inference, often miss or do not reflect current state of the art methodologies. We developed a user interface called DIANE, designed to harness the potential of multi-factorial expression datasets from any organisms through a precise set of methods. DIANE interactive workflow provides normalization, dimensionality reduction, differential expression and ontology enrichment. Gene clustering can be performed and explored via configurable Mixture Models, and Random Forests are used to infer gene regulatory networks. DIANE also includes a novel procedure to assess the statistical significance of regulator-target influence measures based on permutations for Random Forest importance metrics. All along the pipeline, session reports and results can be downloaded to ensure clear and reproducible analyses.\nWe demonstrate the benefits of DIANE using a recently published dataset describing the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana under the combination of temperature, drought and salinity perturbations. We show that DIANE can intuitively carry out informative exploration and statistical procedures with RNA-Seq data, perform model based gene expression profiles clustering and go further into gene network reconstruction, providing relevant candidate genes or signalling pathways to explore. Our novel approach to sparsify the output of Random Forests regulatory weights is benchmarked against two databases of known regulatory interactions in A. thaliana and E. coli, and shows more precise predictions as compared to a naive hard-thresholding of Random Forests importance metrics. DIANE is available as a web service (https://diane.bpmp.inrae.fr), or can be installed and locally launched as a complete R package. For this jobim poster session, we propose a live demonstration of the tool, by conducting a standard analysis of the package\u0026rsquo;s companion dataset.\n","date":1625529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625529600,"objectID":"43ffaf00fcb443341a5a09380f09eafb","permalink":"/talk/jobim_poster/","publishdate":"2021-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/jobim_poster/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of the Dashboard for the Inference and Analysis of Networks from Expression data (DIANE)","tags":[],"title":"Poster - JOBIM","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Océane Cassan","Sophie Lèbre","Antoine Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"14cae10d35b8c665c7605e110afc2108","permalink":"/publication/diane/","publishdate":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diane/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Inferring and analyzing gene regulatory networks from multi-factorial expression data: a complete and interactive suite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Océane Cassan"],"categories":null,"content":"Climate change comes as a major challenge in agroecology, notably through the sustained rise of atmospheric CO2 levels. Field studies conducted worldwide have shown that exposure to elevated CO2 leads to a marked depletion in the content of most nutrients in crops, deteriorating their nutritional value and representing a serious threat to human health. Literature suggests that even though biomass is increased by elevated CO2, the observed mineral depletion is not only due to carbon dilution, but also to negative perturbations on nutritional signaling pathways. However, most of the regulatory mechanisms causing a negative effect on plant mineral nutrition under elevated CO2 remain to be identified. Therefore, in order to preserve food security for the future in a context of sustainable agriculture with low inputs, it is crucial to understand how elevated CO2 impacts regulatory circuits associated with plant mineral nutrition.\nFor this purpose we generated transcriptomic datasets in which Arabidopsis plants were exposed to elevated CO2, low nitrate conditions and iron starvation in a combinatorial fashion. We used it first to investigate how gene expression is being reprogrammed in roots under high atmospheric CO2, and how this response interacts with nutritional starvation pathways. We notably show that elevated CO2 significantly disrupts signaling pathways associated with nitrate and iron starvations.\nThen, we reconstructed a genome-wide network of candidate regulatory interactions of the response to elevated CO2 under low nitrate. We made use of Random Forests, a machine learning approach allowing the extraction of candidate regulatory links between regulators and genes, based on their expression profiles. We developed a statistical procedure to refine this output into a sparse network by empirical tests on the inferred gene pairs. This approach led us to identify several potential regulators of plant response to nutritional limitations under elevated CO2, of which we are currently characterizing the role.\nAltogether, our results indicate that elevated CO2 alters plant response to nutrient starvation, by deregulating nutrient uptake adaptive strategies in roots. This finding, along with the identification of candidate genes from network analysis pave the way for strategies aiming at maintaining plant nutritional value despite the progression of climate change, in a sustainable perspective.\n","date":1619395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619395200,"objectID":"e85f285963bf2a276bdf861f2910d9f9","permalink":"/talk/ipsb_poster/","publishdate":"2021-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ipsb_poster/","section":"talk","summary":"Statistical inference of a gene regulatory network in Arabidopsis under the combination of climate change and nutritional starvations","tags":null,"title":"Poster - International Plant System Biology workshop","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607385600,"objectID":"d51a79d5726acfab48196f01549bb0cc","permalink":"/talk/netbio/","publishdate":"2020-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/netbio/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of the Dashboard for the Inference and Analysis of Networks from Expression data (DIANE)","tags":[],"title":"Talk - Netbio","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dashboard for the Inference and Analysis of Networks from Expression data Application presentation  DIANE is a R-Shiny application for the analysis of high throughput gene expression data (RNA-Seq). Its function is to extract important regulatory pathways involved in the response to environmental changes, or any perturbation inducing genomic modifications.\nGiven the popularity of combinatorial approaches in experimental biology, we designed this tool to process, explore, and perform advanced statistical analysis on multifactorial expression data using state of the art methods. It includes :\n  Raw count data pre-processing and normalization\n  Differential expression analysis and results visualization (Volcano plots, heatmaps, Venn diagrams\u0026hellip;)\n  Gene ontology enrichment analysis\n  Expression based clustering in the framework of Mixture Models, and individual characterization of those clusters (generalized linar models and GO enrichment analysis).\n  Machine learning based Gene Regulatory Network inference and interactive network analysis, community discovery, transcription factor ranking\u0026hellip;\n  Session reporting and results to download at each step of the pipeline\n  Demonstration on a published dataset, and other ready to explore datasets on several organisms\n  All of the features in DIANE are accessible via a single page Shiny application that can be locally launched, or used online at https://diane.bpmp.inrae.fr.\nFor users more familiar with R programming, all server-side functions in DIANE are exported so they can be called from R scripts. Those functions documentation can be found in the Reference, and are illustrated in the corresponding vignette\nUse DIANE locally DIANE relies on R \u0026gt;= 4.0.1, available for all OS at https://cloud.r-project.org/.\nDownload and install DIANE in your R console as follows (you need the remotes package installed install.packages(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;)) :\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;OceaneCsn/DIANE\u0026quot;)  You can then launch the application :\nlibrary(DIANE) DIANE::run_app()  In case your expression input file exceeds 5MB, you may need to run the command options(shiny.maxRequestSize=30*1024^2) before calling DIANE::run_app() to upload up to 30BM.\nOnce the application is launched, if the resolution poorly fits your screen, you can adjust it with the keyboard shortcuts ctrl + or ctrl - (use cmd on Mac).\nDeploy DIANE on your server We provide a solution based on Docker and Shiny server to deploy DIANE on any linux server, just as it is at https://diane.bpmp.inrae.fr. To do so, see the following command line instructions.\nGet DIANE source code via Git :\ngit clone https://github.com/OceaneCsn/DIANE.git  Install Docker engine, as described in the Docker docs.\nGo to DIANE\u0026rsquo;s folder.\nFirst, you can change the default settings for the dockerized shiny-server by editing the file shiny-customized.config (like changing the port, the user to run with, and more)\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s build the image, that we\u0026rsquo;ll name diane, from the Dockerfile (superuser rights required).\ncd DIANE docker build -t diane .  This might take a while. You can check that the container image was built with docker images. Then, you can start the container diane, by setting appropriately the following options in the above command:\n/path/to/app/on/host/ is the path to DIANE on the host, that is to say the location where you cloned it, containing the app.R file. /path/to/logs/on/host/ is the folder you want to store your app logs.\n-p 8086:8086 is the port to use, change the first 8086 to use another one on the host.\n--user shiny allows to run as non root, with the shiny user that must have been created before, and granted rights to the folder /path/to/app/on/host/logs and /path/to/logs/on/host/.\n-d --rm are options for the detached mode.\nPlus, in the following example, a session of DIANE will be allowed to use 16 CPU cores :\ndocker run -d --cpus 16 --user shiny --rm -p 8086:8086 -v /path/to/app/on/host/:/srv/shiny-server/ -v /path/to/logs/on/host/:/var/log/shiny-server/ diane  You can check that the container is running with docker ps.\n Authors : Océane Cassan, Antoine Martin, Sophie Lèbre.\nCode contributions from Alexandre Soriano.\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"041dc6a24aaf19a18f5e40c283d72e04","permalink":"/project/diane/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/diane/","section":"project","summary":"Dashboard for the Inference and Analysis of Networks from Expression data.","tags":["DIANE R package"],"title":"DIANE","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Inside the nucleus, the DNA molecule is dynamically folded so regulatory regions can be in contact. Those physical interactions enable transcription factors to bind to DNA, thus controlling the initiation of genes transcription.\nThe mechanisms of such contacts are still far from being fully understood, as well as the biological parameters driving them. In literature, very few projects focus on DNA sequence as a direct predictor variable for those contacts. The objective of this internship is to determine if sequence alone is enough to predict the distal interactions between regulatory regions, in a statistical learning framework. We propose here methods to build appropriate datasets based on biological experiments, and to extract features using a sequence segmentation approach.Different types of models for supervised classification are trained and compared on those datasets.\nWith our current methods, the results show that the sequence variables of regulatory regions do not seem to carry enough information to accurately predict DNA folding. However, our feature extraction method revealed that the neighborhood of regulatory regions is more informative to predict contacts than the regions themselves, and leads to acceptable classification.\nKeywords:\nChromosomic interactions, machine learning, supervised clas-sification, genomics, feature extraction\n","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"0f8060c65448c569708ca493a3d0bb5d","permalink":"/project/m2/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/m2/","section":"project","summary":"Statistical learning for the prediction of chromosomic interactions","tags":["DIANE R package"],"title":"Master internship project : Statistical learning for the prediction of chromosomic interactions","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jimmy Vandel","Océane Cassan","Sophie Lèbre","Charles-Henri Lecellier","Laurent Bréhélin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"f9421b9fbac00252e2e876aea56e382b","permalink":"/publication/tfcoop/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tfcoop/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Probing transcription factor combinatorics in different promoter classes and in enhancers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Océane Cassan","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
